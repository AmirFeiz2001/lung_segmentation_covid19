# Lung Segmentation for COVID-19 CT Scans

This project implements an Attention U-Net model to segment lung regions and infection masks from COVID-19 CT scans.

## Features
- Convert `.nii` files to `.png` for preprocessing.
- Train an Attention U-Net model on CT scans and lung masks.
- Visualize predictions with original CT images and ground truth masks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmirFeiz2001/lung_segmentation_covid19.git
   cd lung_segmentation_covid19
